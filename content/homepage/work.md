Who are We?
---
At Team Faraday, we are a first year robotics team based out of Edison, NJ. We are affiliated with Edison High School and strive to make robots to compete in the FTC First Tech Challenge. We here at Team Faraday pride ourselves in being able to make the absolute best of the situation to maximize our results. Although the Covid-19 pandemic has restricted us from competing in-person, we have used alternative measures to construct our robot and learn engineering and programming. 


Sponsor Us!
